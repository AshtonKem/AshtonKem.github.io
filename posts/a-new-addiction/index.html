My first decent purchase was a few months ago, but I&rsquo;m counting it as a collection now because I have more pieces than is functionally required, which arguably is 1 in the cell phone era.</p>
<p>Why collect watches? Well, first of all they&rsquo;re modern Mens jewelry. Mens fashion has changed remarkably little in the century, especially compared to Womens&rsquo;. So with suits that may stay &ldquo;in style&rdquo; for 2-6 years depending on the cut, men only have a few places to go to express their style: shoes, watches, ties, and cuff links.</p>
<p>Further still, very few men under the age of 25 (my group at the moment) wear suits. I usually wear a button up or t-shirt to work, and rarely wear any pants more fancy than jeans. This leaves me shoes and watches. This of course also limits my shoe choices a bit, as does the weather in Chicago and my commuting method of choice (bike).</p>
<p>So, that leaves the lonely watch as my main fashion item. What I particularly love about watches is their intricacy, especially mechanical ones. What I love even more about them is how functional yet counter-functional they can be. Watches do one thing quite well: deal with the passing of time. But at the same time, they&rsquo;re hardly required in the era of LED signs, car clocks, and cell phones. Furthermore, many have far more complications (features beyond basic date &amp; time) than most people will use. How many people actually time things with their chronographs? How many divers watches rated to 200m go futher underwater than 8 feet? Not many.</p>
<p>At this point, I have two pieces in my collection which I will photograph and post later:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quartz Fossil chronograph, with leather band.</li>
<li>An Invicta Pro Diver Automatic, in stainless steel.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy both quite a bit. The Fossil has a surprising amount of sentimental value for me already, as it was my Valentine&rsquo;s day gift this year. But I&rsquo;m also growing to love the Invicta, it feels more serious with its weight, and the hands glow to a degree I&rsquo;d never seen before.</p>
<p>Next step? Time to start hitting up estate sales and thrift shops in look of a hidden treasure.</p>
