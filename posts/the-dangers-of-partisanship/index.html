I could go on and on about why it&rsquo;s the best; the regularity, the macros, ClojureScript, core.logic, etc. etc.</p>
<p>But last week I attended <a href="http://lambdajam.com"target="_blank">LambdaJam</a>, which was awesome by the way, and I came back with a different opinion. No, I don&rsquo;t think Haskell or Erlang tops out Clojure, I&rsquo;m still probably going to reach for Leiningen for all my personal projects. But I learned that it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep an eye on other languages, since no language will ever be so good that you never need to touch anything else.</p>
<p>In particular I learned the joy of the APL based languages, especially J. I learned that the F# people have a novel way of dealing with statically typing external resources via type providers, and I learned that Haskell can indeed be tight and clean despite what all those monad tutorials imply. I will probably take each of these subjects apart in separate posts in the future, I&rsquo;m still trying to pick up bits and pieces of my thoughts after several intense key notes overloaded my brain.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the take away? That functional languages are a lot more diverse than most OOP/procedural languages, and that there&rsquo;s a lot that can be learned from them. So instead of picking your favorite and only learning that, you really should try to learn several to cover your bases.</p>
