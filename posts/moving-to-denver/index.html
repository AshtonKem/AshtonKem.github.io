embarrassing someone else&rsquo;s Facebook account? Apparently in the improv
community of Chicago the standard prank is to post something saying that
they&rsquo;ve accepted a lead role, and that they&rsquo;re moving to Denver,
Colorado. We found this out when some improv actors at our going away
party took some convincing that we were actually moving, and that it
wasn&rsquo;t an elaborate prank.</p>
<p>The main difference for us is that I&rsquo;ve not decided to give up software
engineering for comedy. Instead I&rsquo;ve accepted a role as an engineer at
<a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com"target="_blank">Pivotal Tracker</a>, which I personally think is a
better deal. Pivotal is a great company with a unique and productive
style, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to be working with them.</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;ll always be a special place in my heart for Chicago, I&rsquo;m
rather glad we&rsquo;ve made the move. It was stressful and very expensive,
but living in Colorado has already been a very pleasant experience. The
weather is shockingly nice, apartments are a nicer for the price, and I
can safely walk to work.</p>
<p>Expect photos from the mountains and trails above Denver in the coming
months.</p>
