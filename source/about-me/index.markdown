Hi! I'm Ashton. I'm a polyglot programmer based out of Chicago
Illinois. I currently work for Narrative Science, a AI based startup
specializing in natural language generation. Basically we take data in,
analyze it, and turn it into English. I'm part of our data team, which
means that it's my job to ingest, clean, and analyze any data that we
need. My biggest project is managing the backend and frontend for
[Quill for Google Analytics](http://quillga.narrativescience.com),
which generates a narrative for users based on their websites
Google Analytics data. It's my responsibility to add new data to the
project, add features to the website that displays reports to the users,
and make sure that both are bug free.

While I currently work in Python, I'm really a functional programmer at
heart. I have professional experience in Common Lisp, and have played
with every functional language I've come across. I'm particularly
interested in Clojure, Haskell, and Erlang. I think Clojure +
ClojureScript is a particularly compelling combination for the future of
functional programming, and I'm really excited to try it out.

On the side I work on a few open source projects, including
[Butler](https://github.com/AshtonKem/Butler), my Emacs plugin for
Jenkins and friends. This project was started after a short stint
using Eclipse, which made me realize how much I needed CI information
brought directly to me in my editor. Butler works by using Jenkins JSON
API to check on the status of jobs, view progress, and trigger new ones.
I'm also currently rewriting the client management software for the local
food pantry in Ruby on Rails.

Outside of programming I'm a bicyclist and amateur photographer. More
uniquely (at least for a programmer) I'm a big fan of anything
historical; I can make my own chainmaille, both armor and jewelry, and
am currently taking classes in medieval swordsmanship. I also really
enjoy hiking, which unfortunately doesn't work out so well for me in
Illinois.

My [fiance](http://about.me/lcbarren) introduced me into hiking and camping. She is also a writer, a
productivity expert, and the Chicago Market Director for
[UrbanBuddy](http://www.urbanbuddy.com). We have two cats, Abe and Woz,
who are brothers and co-conspirators in all our household mischief.
