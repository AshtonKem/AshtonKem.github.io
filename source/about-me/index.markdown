Hi! I'm Ashton. I'm a polyglot programmer based out of Chicago Illinois. I currently work for Narrative Science, a AI based startup specializing in natural language generation. Basically we take data in, analyze it, and turn it into English.

I currently work in Python, but I'm really a functional programmer at heart. I have professional experience in Common Lisp, and have played with every functional language I've come across. I'm particularly interested in Clojure, Haskell, and Erlang. Which one do I prefer? Well, it depends on what I'm trying to do.

On the side I work on a few open source projects, including [Butler](https://github.com/AshtonKem/Butler), my Emacs plugin for Jenkins and friends. I'm also involved in rewriting some software for my local food pantry.

Beyond programming I am a bicycling enthusiast and an amateur photographer. I also have two adorable cats.
