Hi! I'm Ashton. I'm a polyglot programmer based out of Denver
Colorado. I work for [Pivotal Labs](http://www.pivotallabs.com) on the
[Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com) team. Technically I work on the
"Platform" side, which means I'm responsible most of the non-Javascript
stuff that goes on with Tracker.

While I currently work in Ruby, I'm really a functional programmer at
heart. I have professional experience in Common Lisp, and have played
with every functional language I've come across. I'm particularly
interested in Clojure, Haskell, and Erlang. I think Clojure +
ClojureScript is a particularly compelling combination for the future of
functional programming, and I'm really excited to try it out.

On the side I work on a few open source projects, including
[Butler](https://github.com/AshtonKem/Butler), my Emacs plugin for
Jenkins and friends. This project was started after a short stint
using Eclipse, which made me realize how much I needed CI information
brought directly to me in my editor. Butler works by using Jenkins JSON
API to check on the status of jobs, view progress, and trigger new ones.
I'm also currently rewriting the client management software for the local
food pantry in Ruby on Rails.

Outside of programming I'm a bicyclist and amateur photographer. More
uniquely (at least for a programmer) I'm a big fan of anything
historical; I can make my own chainmaille, both armor and jewelry, and
am currently taking classes in medieval swordsmanship. I also really
enjoy hiking, which unfortunately doesn't work out so well for me in
Illinois.

My [fiance](http://about.me/lcbarren) introduced me into hiking and
camping. She is also a writer, a productivity expert, and a Customer
Support Representative for [Gnip](http://www.gnip.com). We have two cats, Abe
and Woz, who are brothers and co-conspirators in all our household
mischief.
