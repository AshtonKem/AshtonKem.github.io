Hi! I'm Ashton. I'm a polyglot programmer based out of Denver,
Colorado. I work for [Pivotal Labs](http://www.pivotallabs.com) on the
[Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com) team. Originally I worked on
the Ruby end of things, but since then I have been switched to a 100%
Javascript and Backbone.js role.

While I currently work in Ruby and Javascript, I'm really a functional
programmer at heart. I have professional experience in Common Lisp, and
have played with every functional language I've come across. Previously
I played around with Lisp, Haskell, and Erlaing, but these days I mostly
work with Clojure. I think Clojure
+ ClojureScript is a particularly compelling combination for the future
of functional programming, and I really love working with it. I even
snuck a bit of each into the Tracker codebase when nobody was looking
because it's just so good for testing.

On the side I work on a few open source projects, including
[Butler](https://github.com/AshtonKem/Butler), my Emacs plugin for
Jenkins and friends. This project was started after a short stint
using Eclipse, which made me realize how much I needed CI information
brought directly to me in my editor. Butler works by using Jenkins JSON
API to check on the status of jobs, view progress, and trigger new ones.
I'm also currently rewriting the client management software for the local
food pantry in Ruby on Rails.

Outside of programming I'm a bicyclist and amateur photographer. More
uniquely (at least for a programmer) I'm a big fan of anything
historical; I can make my own chainmaille, both armor and jewelry, and
am currently taking classes in medieval swordsmanship. I also really
enjoy hiking, which is one of the reasons why we live in Colorado.

My fiance introduced me into hiking and camping. She is also a writer
and a Partner Engineer for [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com). We have
two cats, Abe and Woz, who are brothers and co-conspirators in all our
household mischief.
