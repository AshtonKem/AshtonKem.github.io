Hi! I'm Ashton. I'm a polyglot programmer based out of Chicago. I work
for [DRW Trading](http://www.drw.com).

While I've worked in a lot of OOP languages, I'm really a functional
programmer at heart. I have professional experience in Common Lisp, and
have played with every functional language I've come across. Previously
I played around with Lisp, Haskell, and Erlaing, but these days I mostly
work with Clojure. I think Clojure and ClojureScript are a particularly
compelling combination for the future of functional programming, and I
really love working with it.

On the side I work on a few open source projects, including
[Butler](https://github.com/AshtonKem/Butler), my Emacs plugin for
Jenkins and friends. This project was started after a short stint
using Eclipse, which made me realize how much I needed CI information
brought directly to me in my editor. Butler works by using Jenkins JSON
API to check on the status of jobs, view progress, and trigger new ones.

Outside of programming I'm a bicyclist and amateur photographer. More
uniquely (at least for a programmer) I'm a big fan of anything
historical; I can make my own chainmaille, both armor and jewelry, and
am currently taking classes in medieval swordsmanship.

My fiance introduced me into hiking and camping. She is also a writer
and a Partner Engineer for [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com). We have
two cats, Abe and Woz, who are brothers and co-conspirators in all our
household mischief.
