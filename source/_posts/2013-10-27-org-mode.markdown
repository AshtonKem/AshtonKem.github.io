Recently I've taken interest in making myself more productive, and at
least so far it's going well. I personally attribute part of my current
productivity to a new "shut up and get back to work" mentality, and
partly to a new (to me) organization system.

I know there are literally thousands of posts related to productivity
and organization systems, but there are shockingly few related to my
system of choice, Emacs. In this post I'll cover the typical path a task
takes from creation all the way to completion (or abandonment). I'll
also toss in some relevant code & configuration snippets for my fellow
Emacs user.

TODO: Overview of org-mode & terminology.

TODO: Explain where all my org files are stored/symlinked.

By and far, the most important part of my system is the capture phase. I
use [MobileOrg](TODO: find link) to capture ideas as I have them on my
phone, and capture mode itself in Emacs when I'm at my
computer. MobileOrg is hooked up to the Apps/MobileOrg folder in my drop
box. The following variables ensure that Emacs can push to Dropbox
correctly, and that it knows where to find tasks created in MobileOrg

``` scheme
(setq org-mobile-inbox-for-pull "~/org/flagged.org"
      org-mobile-directory "~/Dropbox/Apps/MobileOrg")
```

After a task is created, it's time to review and organize. From Emacs
 <code>M-x org-mobile-pull</code> pulls values in from Dropbox, and
 opens up the flagged.org file. The command <code>C-x C-w</code> will
 allow us to "refile" this item to the relevant org file. Normally
 refile only allows us to make this item a child of another heading in
 another file, but the following snippet allows us to refile as a base
 level item

``` scheme
(setq org-refile-targets '((nil :maxlevel . 2)
                           (org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 2)))

(setq org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes 'confirm
      org-refile-use-outline-path 'file)
```
