Recently I've taken interest in making myself more productive, and at
least so far it's going well. I personally attribute part of my current
productivity to a new "shut up and get back to work" mentality, and
partly to a new (to me) organization system.

I know there are literally thousands of posts related to productivity
and organization systems, but there are shockingly few related to my
system of choice, Emacs. I'll be covering the basics of org-mode, with
more configuration and workflow information in a future post.

Org-mode is both an Emacs library, and a file format. The org form is
designed to be both human readable, and powerful when parsed; it
resembles a markdown designed for outlines.

The basic element is the headline, which is prefixed with a number of
asteriks. The number of asteriks controls which lines are children of
which. Each headline can optionally have a todo state, which by default
is one of "TODO", "IN-PROGRESS", and "DONE". You can configure multiple
types of todo states that flow from one to another in whichever way you
want.
