Is the one you already own.

No, seriously. You probably have a good enough camera already. Despite everything that Nikon and Canon says in the desperate hope that they will sell you junk you don’t need, very few people really truly need to upgrade their camera.

Sure, there are a handful of features that might be helpful in fringe circumstances. If you shoot sports you will want high frame rates, and if you shoot at night you’ll want a better meter and remote triggering for those long exposures. But easily 90% of real world photography doesn’t fall into those categories. If you just want to take better pictures of the world around you, take your camera and put it into the backpack you carry daily.

The best camera is the one you have with you. A tiny 1.3 megapixel pocket camera can easily make 8×10″ prints for your wall, and it sure beats no camera at all. Even an iPhone camera is good enough, this is why Chase Jarvis has gotten famous (again) for his work with iPhones.

Better still, a simple camera with almost no features will help you concentrate on what’s important, the image itself. Want to know what those rich guys with big photo backpacks spend all of their time doing? Worrying about lens sharpness and trying to decide whether or not they should change lenses or cameras. They almost never produce any good images. It’s only once you start to ignore your equipment and concentrate on your work that you will finally produce mind blowing pictures.
