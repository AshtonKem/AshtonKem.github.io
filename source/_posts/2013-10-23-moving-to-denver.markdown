You know those hilarious "pranks" where someone posts something
embarassing someone else's Facebook account? Apparently in the improv
community of Chicago the standard prank is to post something saying that
they've accepted a lead role, and that they're moving to Denver,
Colorado. We found this out when some improv actors at our going away
party took some convincing that we were actually moving, and that it
wasn't an elaborate prank.

As you might've guessed, I've recently moved from Chicago to Denver. The
only twist is that instead of accepting a lead role in some play, I've
accepted a position on the [Pivotal Tracker](www.pivotaltracker.com)
team.

While there'll always be a special place in my heart for Chicago, I'm
rather glad we've made the move. It was stressful and very expensive,
but living in Colorado has already been a very pleasant experience. The
weather is shockingly nice, apartments are a bit nicer for the same
price range, and I can safely walk to work.

Expect photos from the mountains and trails above Denver in the coming
months.
