You know those hilarious "pranks" where someone posts something embarassing via a logged in Facebook account? Apparently in the improv community of Chicago the standard prank is to post something along the lines of "I'd love to thank the Chicago improv community so much for its love and support, so it's with mixed feelings that I annouce that I've taken a lead role in Denver Colorado!" I found this out during our going away party in Chicago, where some improv actors at the bar thought we were joking.

As you might've guessed, I've recently moved from Chicago to Denver. The only twist is that instead of accepting a lead role in some play, I've accepted a position on the [Pivotal Tracker](www.pivotaltracker.com) team. So if you're using Tracker at work/home, then you're welcome and/or I'm sorry.

While there'll always be a special place in my heart for Chicago, I'm rather glad we've made the move. It was stressful and very expensive, but living in Colorado has already been a very pleasant experience. The weather is shockingly nice, apartments are a bit nicer for the same price range, and I can safely walk to work.

Expect photos from the mountains and trails above Denver in the coming months.
