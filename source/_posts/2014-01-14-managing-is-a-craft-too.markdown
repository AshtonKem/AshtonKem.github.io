I'm getting a little tired of seeing posts saying that the best managers
must be an ex-engineer or a current one. I think coding skill is a very
narrow minded way to judge both a human and a professional, and a
terrible way to run a business.

Here's the simple truth, a manager is a craftsperson just like a
designer or engineer. The only difference is that their craft is
organizing people, not designs or code. In their trade the best tools
are flexibility, communication, empathy, and comprehension. My personal
opinion is that a good manager is at least as hard to find as a good
engineer, if not harder.

To say that a manager of engineers needs to know how code and needs to
code daily is like saying that you have to be a doctor to manage a
doctor's office, and that you need to be practicing right now. While a
bit of knowledge aids in communication, there are a wide range of tasks
that need to be performed that are *not* coding. And to ignore these
tasks would be just as disastrous as not writing the software that the
company sells.

We've all heard the horror stories of non-engineer managers not knowing
or caring what engineers do, or the ex-engineer manager thinking that
they're still on the team when their knowledge is 20 years out of
date. Clearly both of these people are being ineffective managers, but
not because of whether or not they can code. These people are being bad
managers because they are not *listening* to their staff. Anyone, coder
or not, will be a terrible manager without the requisite people skills.

So hire and keep managers that listen and communicate well. Managers
that manage expectations of those uphill and divert shit rolling
downhill. The best manager is the one that helps their team be the best,
whether or not there are any commits with their name on it.
