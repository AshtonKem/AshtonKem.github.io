[Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com) gives a great talk about Time
and Attention. The gist of his talk is that in order to create great
work, you need to balance time vs. attention. Without using your time,
you'll never create. But you must use your attention to determine if
you're creating something great. Great producers balance between these
two to both produce, and produce good work.

Part of my new job at [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com)
involves pair programming. While a lot of my programming friends express
doubt about pairing, I'm very impressed with both how productive I am
pairing, and how quickly I'm learning the code base while pairing.

The way that a good pair switches between who is "driving" reminds me of
Merlin's talk. The person who is typing is responsible for producing,
while the person who isn't is responsible for ensuring that the pair is
headed in the right direction.

Blah blah blah. This works better because there's an overt marker for
when to switch between time + attention, e.g. when someone switches from
watching to driving. Figure out better wording here.
