One of the most scary moments in most young adults' life is the
realization of mortality. Teenagers and younger children often
understand on an intellectual level that people die, but emotionally
that's something that happens to other people. There's very few things
quite like the moment when an adult realizes that they must die, there's
nothing they can do to stop it, and there's not a lot they can do to
delay it.

Most people stop there. But if you move beyond the "go to work, make
money, enjoy weekend" stage of your life, you'll get to experience what
I call "Opportunity Cost Fear".

Every action you take prevents you from taking another. Spending $10 on
a lunch means you can't spend that $10 on anything else. This is called
opportunity cost. It applies to every limited resource in the
world. Your time, attention, money, emotions, energy, and physical
strength are all subject to opportunity cost, even though many people
and organizations do not think about it.

Those who wish to accomplish many things can suffer a crippling fear
because of it. Spending time on this blog post means I'm spending time
not reading blogs, writing software, or talking with Leah. It also means
I'm not spending my time going to the gym to be healthy, or trying to
make friends in a new city. And the fact that I can't have everything I
want, just like the fact that I can't live forever, can be deeply
terrifying if you care about doing multiple things.

Just like the fear of death, the best way out of opportunity cost fear
is to press forward. The big risk with both is that the fear will
cripple you to the point where the worst might as well have
happened. Are you really living if you spend every moment terrified of
your own end? What's the point worrying about opportunity cost if the
fear prevents you from executing on any of your plans? In both these
cases, the fear alone can be just as bad as the actual outcome.

Now, I'm not saying that the rational choice is disregard for the
objects of your fear. If you're afraid of death, riding a motorcycle
without a helmet on will neither eliminate your fear or increase your
lifespan. You should be aware of why you feared a thing, and take the
most rational steps to reduce it. Nothing you will do can ever eliminate
opportunity cost, but you can make sure that you're spending your time
as best you can. You'll never do it perfectly, but it's better than
nothing at all.
