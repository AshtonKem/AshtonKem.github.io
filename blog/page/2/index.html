  <div class="entry-content"><p>No programming language stands alone. Besides the compiler, every
programming language includes an ecosystem of libraries, build tools,
analyzers, debuggers, and other utilities. Languages often rise and fall
depending on the quality of these tools and libraries.</p>

<p>For every language there needs to be one central item upon which every
other tool depends. In most languages, this is the compiler or
interpreter. Your Rails project is entirely dependent on the version of
Ruby provided by the current environment, and similarly Maven depends on
the version of javac and java available on the path.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this makes our code more fragile and dependent on the
machine it was first created on. Someone cloning your code from a
different machine must take care to ensure that their development
environment is close to the original authors, and deployment must ship
the correct compilers and interpeters for production to work well. We
have created tools to help enforce the requirements of the code, but
they are fragile and make upgrading dependencies a pain, as anyone who
has had to fight with RVM can attest.</p>

<p>The one exception to this I have found is Clojure. Clojure inverts the
normal order making the build tool the central item, with the compiler
provided by the project definition file.</p>

<p>The beauty of this change is that it makes setup trivial for another
developer. All they need is the same build tool, and it will deal with
the correct versions of both the compiler and any libraries for the
project. Have other projects that depend on different versions of the
compiler? The build tool only cares about the dependencies in front of
it, and will call the correct version from the correct project.</p>

<p>This also makes upgrading trivial. Want to try Clojure 1.6.0? Change
&#8220;1.5.1&#8221; to &#8220;1.6.0&#8221; in the above snippet. Want to write a library that
supports multiple versions of the compiler? The build tool supports
profiles which allow you to swap out compilers trivially because it&#8217;s
just a dependency.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Deployment gets easier as well. If you&#8217;re deploying an uberjar, the core
libraries you tested against are also shipped to production in the same
jar. No need to upgrade your deployment scripts when a new version of
Clojure comes out, as everything is included automatically.</p>

<p>There is one catch to this wonderfulness, which is that Clojure depends
on the JVM, and the build tool cannot change the JVM around. But Clojure
has very simple requirements, Java 1.6 or greater, which
makes it simple to deploy anywhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my hobbies is fencing. Not modern Olympic fencing, but 14th
century longsword fencing in the Italian school. In every class the
instructor reminds us that we should act &#8220;like haughty Italian nobles,
tall and relaxed&#8221; in the way that we stand, move, and handle the weapon.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;Sprezzatura&#8221; crops up a lot in these discussions. The simplest
translation is literally &#8220;disdain&#8221;, but a more careful translation would
be &#8220;studied carelessness&#8221;. To act with Sprezzatura means to make learned
actions look easy and natural.</p>

<p>It turns out there is a really good reason for a fencer to act this
way. A relaxed and calm fencer can move more rapidly and adjust their
actions depending on whether they are winning or losing the bind. Their
actions happen without any tell, catching their opponent by surprise and
allowing them to act within their opponents tempo. In sword fighting the
ultimate goal is to strike your opponent without being hit. Thus the
shortest and simplest actions are favored, as large embellished actions
only increase personal risk.</p>

<p>There is a similar grace in programming. While programming is not
usually a competitive or dangerous hobby, there are practical benefits
to acting quickly and gracefully. The most effective engineer completes
their task with the minimal amount of time and added complexity. Showing
off in the code only increases the risk of regressions and makes the
code harder to modify later. The ultimate goal is a maintainable
application that meets requirements in the minimal amount of time, and
an accomplished engineer will take the shortest route to that goal.</p>

<p>Sword fighting is not about strength. It is never effective to swing a
sword with all of your strength. Even if this wasn&#8217;t unsafe and an
obvious tell, it isn&#8217;t a good way to cut with an edged weapon. Swords
depend on a cutting edge to do damage, and thus a smooth arc that draws
the weapon through the target will always cut more effectively than a
ham-fisted baseball swing.</p>

<p>Similarly, the accomplished engineer knows that completing a task is not
about the number of hours spent, but the quality. The mind is a tool
that can be both sharpened and dulled with both work and rest, and
programming is a task of the mind. Thus the quality engineer avoids
excessive hours, as they are unhealthy and ineffective. Instead the
engineer makes their limited productive hours as effective as possible
without excessive strain.</p>

<p>It may not be the connection you expected, but humans haven&#8217;t changed in
a very long time. Even if our circumstances have changed, there is
always something to be learned from even the most esoteric sources.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m getting a little tired of seeing posts saying that the best managers
must be an ex-engineer or a current one. I think coding skill is a very
narrow minded way to judge both a human and a professional, and a
terrible way to run a business.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the simple truth, a manager is a craftsperson just like a
designer or engineer. The only difference is that their craft is
organizing people, not designs or code. In their trade the best tools
are flexibility, communication, empathy, and comprehension. My personal
opinion is that a good manager is at least as hard to find as a good
engineer, if not harder.</p>

<p>To say that a manager of engineers needs to know how code and needs to
code daily is like saying that you have to be a doctor to manage a
doctor&#8217;s office, and that you need to be practicing right now. While a
bit of knowledge aids in communication, there are a wide range of tasks
that need to be performed that are <em>not</em> coding. And to ignore these
tasks would be just as disastrous as not writing the software that the
company sells.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the horror stories of non-engineer managers not knowing
or caring what engineers do, or the ex-engineer manager thinking that
they&#8217;re still on the team when their knowledge is 20 years out of
date. Clearly both of these people are being ineffective managers, but
not because of whether or not they can code. These people are being bad
managers because they are not <em>listening</em> to their staff. Anyone, coder
or not, will be a terrible manager without the requisite people skills.</p>

<p>So hire and keep managers that listen and communicate well. Managers
that manage expectations of those uphill and divert shit rolling
downhill. The best manager is the one that helps their team be the best,
whether or not there are any commits with their name on it.</p>

<time datetime="2014-01-06T22:48:00-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 6<span>th</span>, 2014</time>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Martin Grüner had a <a href="http://martingryner.com/software-localization-is-tricky/">fun</a> article about his experience writing an internationalized app. I thought it would be fun to share my own experiences.</p>

<p>My first job out of college was working on a Common Lisp (CL) web application. The application was only a few years younger than me, and had originally written in CL due to a particularly good HTML/XML library available in CL at the time. Unfortunately in the intervening years the HTML library stopped being state of the art, and the whims of enterprise software engineering had left CL behind for web development, resulting in a serious lack of common programming conveniences.</p>

<p>Right after joining the company, I was informed that the sales person had a potential lead with clients in a Spanish speaking country. The application at this point was English only, but the QA engineer was married to a native Spanish speaker who was willing to help translate the application. All we needed to do was wire the application up for internationalization and localization. I was tasked with picking or creating a library and interspersing it throughout the application. The only criteria was that it both looked good and was capable of displaying different languages to different users depending on their browser&#8217;s &#8220;accept-language&#8221; header. So compiling or packaging up a new application with hard-coded languages was not an option.</p>

<p>I eventually decided that all the existing libraries were insufficient and we needed to make our own. I&#8217;m still not sure if that was the right choice or not. CL doesn&#8217;t have the strongest library ecosystem around, but I was also a very young engineer and more susceptible to the &#8220;Not Invented Here&#8221; syndrome than I am now. Although a quick perusal through the current offerings involves libraries whose home pages are 404s, libraries who are nothing but FFI bindings to a GNU C library, and those whose list of defects includes &#8220;no documentation&#8221;, &#8220;undocumented code&#8221; and &#8220;slow PO parser&#8221;.</p>

<p>Compounding the issue was CL&#8217;s format function. CL has an exceedingly powerful formatter that is capable of unwrapping loops and interspersing the correct combination of &#8220;,&#8221; and &#8220;and&#8221; for a list of strings. This function was used with (reckless) abandon throughout the codebase, something for which I deserve some blame. The lack of dedicated template files compounded the issues; it&#8217;s a lot easier to reach for format when you&#8217;re producing HTML the handler-function itself.</p>

<p>There was no way I was going to explain the (non-technical) translator how to deal with format directives like this: &#8220;~#[NONE~;~a~;~a and ~a~:;~a, ~a~]~#[~; and ~a~:;, ~a, etc~].&#8221;, and I didn&#8217;t want to dig through 500kloc and unroll all the directives. So any translation system I made would need to support at least a subset of the CL formatting directives while hiding them for the translator&#8217;s sanity.</p>

<p>Worse still, CL&#8217;s formatter accepts positional arguments only, to my knowledge. Thus there&#8217;s no particular way to convince the formatter to modify the order of the parameters if the target language has different language structure than English. So my system would need to deal with that.</p>

<p>The final format I settled on would look something like this. The programmer (me) would change (format nil &#8220;~a&#8221; var) to (jibberish:format &#8220;&lt;~a:variable-name&gt;&#8221; &#8220;Descriptive sentence for translator&#8221; :variable-name var). We could then convince our code to print out a file for a language like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>####################################
</span><span class='line'>File: filename.cl
</span><span class='line'>####################################
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Original: &lt;variable-name&gt;
</span><span class='line'>Translation: Translation goes here
</span><span class='line'>Note for translator: Descriptive sentence for translator
</span><span class='line'>Original Argument Order: [variable-name]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And so on. At runtime the language file would be parsed into a in-memory hash map, which would allow us to replace the format-string with the new one, re-order the argument list according to the translator&#8217;s needs, and strip the identifiers from the formatting string leaving the raw format directives.</p>

<p>So, how&#8217;d I do? Mixed results. The conversion was long and painful, requiring that each format directive and raw string be touched. A huge portion of the &#8220;Notes for translator&#8221; were either blank due to difficulty and fatigue, or were something along the line &#8220;Description, part 1/n&#8221; due to multiple calls being joined together in HTML. Changes in formatting calls required that the matching translation entry be hunted down <em>in every translation file</em> for the translation to still work.</p>

<p>But technical challenges are usually not a big deal, after all that&#8217;s a fairly large portion of what engineers do. Probably the worst problem with my system was how it worked for non-technical folk. The first attempt at giving this file to a translator resulted in her helpfully translating all the variable names into spanish, changing &#8220;It is &lt;today&gt;&#8221; to &#8220;que es &lt;hoy&gt;&#8221;, which resulted in some rather exciting errors. I think my own design sabotaged me in this particular instance, as it required way too much careful explanation to be usable. It was my first encounter with the major difference between using a program whose internals you are familiar and explaining its use to someone else who has never seen anything similar.</p>

<p>I think if I had to do it again, I would&#8217;ve probably spent more time and modified the way the program generated strings instead. I suspect that my custom library avoiding refactoring everything was a case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_economy">false economy</a>, as the time saved up front would have been lost in the time required to train translators and maintain overly fragile translation files. I also learned that if you plan on selling an application in another language market, you need to think about that <em>before</em> you start writing code. Internationalization limits some of the choices you can make with your software and design, and it&#8217;s a lot easier to use that restricted set up front than it is to unwind them after the fact.</p>

<p>As a final irony, while attempting to write this post in Octopress (which uses Jekyll), it crashed several times because the SASS files in Octopress use unicode, which Octopress appears to hate out of the box. You have to change a few environment variables to convince it that Unicode is ok.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my new job at Pivotal Labs I&#8217;ve been pair programming almost
every day. The obvious challenge with pair programming, especially in a
popular language like ruby, is in choosing what tools to work with. Vim,
Emacs, RubyMine, TextMate, the choices are various and divisive.</p>

<p>To make peace among the engineers, it makes sense to dictate one set of
tools to make peace among all your employees, and to make provisioning
the machines easier. Pivotal has decided to standardize on RubyMine with
a dark color scheme and a few custom configurations.</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>

<p>RubyMine, being set up for ruby in particular, works very well with
navigating, indenting, and colorizing ruby code. With the exception of
setting a variable as the result of an if expression, I have never seen
RubyMine indent code incorrectly or get confused on coloration.</p>

<p>It also does a decent job of navigating to ruby classes and functions,
something that is quite hard since ruby lacks explicit import
semantics. It definitely makes hunting down odd test harness functions
down a breeze, and has saved me in the past. It also is good at
identifying the view that cooresponds to a controller method, but due to
the way that tracker is laid out, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to use this
feature often.</p>

<p>And as the cherry on top RubyMine includes a &#8220;Textmate like&#8221; quick find
feature. In large code bases this will save you about a minute trying to
find a particular file, so ling as you have an idea of what it&#8217;s called!</p>

<h1>The Bad</h1>

<p>If you only have unique controllers and models, you will absolutely love
the ability to jump to a class definition. Since we use a lot of
similarly named controllers inside namespaces to control API versions,
it often gets confused about what version I want. The quick find feature
sometimes ignores the path if you provide it, which makes copying files
from stacktraces occasionally unreliable.</p>

<p>Javascript and less support is mediocre. No real complaints, but nothing
to set it apart from other environments in my opinion. Maybe my
colleagues who work on the front end would have a more nuanced opinion.</p>

<p>Also sometimes with large files the coloring or error checking can lag
behind. This usually kicks in at files longer than 3000 lines, which is
not unusual for test files. For the most part this is just an annoyance
which doesn&#8217;t affect editing in any serious way.</p>

<p>It has git integration, which lags behind the offerings from Emacs, Vim,
and Eclipse in my opinion. I end up using the command line instead of
the built in tools.</p>

<h1>The Ugly</h1>

<p>RubyMine is incredibly dim witted when it comes to parenthesis and
quotes. If you wish to put an escaped quote at the end of a string,
RubyMine will let you escape your ending quote, then insert a matching
pair right afterwords when you try and fix the mistake! To add insult to
injury, you must move the cursor before fixing the issue lest RubyMine
delete both of the extra quotes. Very frustrating.</p>

<p>RubyMine is also one of the most memory consuming programs I use. At
least once a week it will grind my machine to a halt due to memory
usage, which is impressive on a machine with 16G in memory.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>Out of the box, RubyMine works very well. I think it is a good
compromise for large teams. But if you have time to learn some more
complicated tools, I believe you would be way better off learning a more
customizable editor like Emacs or Vim. It might take some effort, but
these editors can do just as much as their commercial cousins and will
continue to do well no matter what language you decide to use in the
future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve taken interest in making myself more productive, and at
least so far it&#8217;s going well. I personally attribute part of my current
productivity to a new &#8220;shut up and get back to work&#8221; mentality, and
partly to a new (to me) organization system.</p>

<p>The problem I&#8217;ve had is that every single organization app is broken in
some way. The only truly flexible system uses paper and pen, and I
don&#8217;t really want to deal with that.</p>

<p>The solution appears to be org-files. Think of them as a close cousin to
Markdown, but for organization instead of HTML. The systems that use
org-files support basically any kind of work flow imaginable because
the storage mechanism is just text, so in the worst case scenario you
can always just edit the file manually.</p>

<p>Org-files are originally from the Emacs plugin org-mode, but there are
now org-file readers for Vim, iPhone, and Android.</p>

<h2>Okay Ashton, What the Hell is That?</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s break this down bit by bit. Any line starting with <code>#+</code>
is used to tell the org-mode reader something. In this case it lets us
know the last time we synced this to our mobile device, and the possible
TODO states that an item can be in. It&#8217;s not unusual to see formatting
directives at the top of the file to control color, indentation, and
similar settings. A lot of settings can either be set globally, or on a
per-file basis.</p>

<p>Next we have the individual headings. Each heading starts with a number
of asterisks. The number of asterisks indicates the level. So
<code>&#42;&#42; Wish List.</code> is a child of <code>&#42;
Butler</code>. Most editors allow you to fold headings to show or hide
their children, for convenience.</p>

<p>Each heading can optionally have a TODO state, which is displayed in
front of the heading title.. The default is one of blank, TODO,
IN-PROGRESS, and DONE. A simple keystroke in most editors cycles from
one state to the next. It&#8217;s also possible to support multiple paths that
a project can flow through. I personally use the default along with
REFERENCE and ABANDONED, which allows for me to easily filter for
abandoned projects, along with notes that aren&#8217;t actionable yet.</p>

<p>Org-mode supports 3 different kinds of time tracking and
scheduling. Each heading can have up to one deadline entry, one
scheduled entry, and multiple clock entries. Deadlines are for when an
item should be finished, and scheduled is for when a project should be
started. Clocks are for recording the amount of time used for an
item. You can see an example of both the deadline and clock under the
&#8220;Better formatting.&#8221;  header. Org-mode also supports a very flexible
type of repeat scheduling.</p>

<p>With any good organization system you&#8217;ll need the ability to tag and
filter items. Org provides two ways to do this, properties and
tags. Tags are generally shared across multiple entries, with values
like &#8220;work&#8221; and &#8220;home&#8221;. They are displayed on the far right of the
tagged line, such as &#8220;:projects:&#8221; on the Butler line above. You can tag
a line with as many tags as you want.</p>

<p>Unlike tags, properties are composed of keys and values, many of which
are unique to a specific entry. If you use any kind of syncing system,
each item will get an ID property used to enforce uniqueness. A lot of
systems will also respect the LOCATION property if you sync to a system
that understands this, such as iCal.</p>

<p>And finally you can have notes and text underneath each entry. Most
org-mode readers understand free text, unordered lists (<code>-</code>
or <code>+</code>), numbered lists, and check boxes (<code>- [ ]</code>
and <code>- [X]</code>). Many of these can be easily manipulated with
simple keyboard macros, such as the check boxes.</p>

<p>As you can see, org-mode basically provides a super set of all the
organizational features available. It&#8217;s up to you how you wish to nest
these, mark them due, and prioritize. That&#8217;s why I love it, I&#8217;m not
locked into one particular layout that may or may not fit me, instead I
can slowly evolve it as my systems mature. Expect more posts in the
future about Emacs specific configuration settings to make org-mode
easier to use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Edit: Dan Benjamin himself informed me that I missed the sarcasm boat
here. I&#8217;m leaving the relevant bits, and cutting out the now irrelevant
criticism.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m slowly working my way through the <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a>
podcast. I&#8217;m way behind, so please excuse that this post references an
episode over 2 years old at this point.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/11">Episode 11</a> was about &#8220;future proofing your
passion&#8221;, among other things. In it, Merlin mentions that one thing you
can do as a low risk investment in a programming career is to maintain
current on new languages. He mentions Scala, Erlang, and Lisp as a
few. With an <del>uncharacteristic lack of self-awareness</del> unusual
amount of sarcasm, Dan expresses pretty much disdain and lack of
interest in anything other than Ruby, even going as far as saying &#8220;Ruby
took the best of Lisp&#8221;.</p>

<p>While Dan may have been joking, it is probably worth examining the
relationship between Ruby and Lisp. As someone who has worked in Ruby
and Lisp professionally, I feel uniquely qualified to talk about their
relative strengths. While there are a ton of cases where Ruby clearly
learned and copied from Lisp, there is also a laundry list of areas
where Ruby failed to learn from Lisp&#8217;s successes and failures.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>Being a functional language, functions are pretty important to Common
Lisp. Ruby thankfully took some of the highlights from CL during its
development, like a heavy emphasis on using map &amp; filter over iterative
loops, but it missed some important things.</p>

<p>CL only has one kind of function, the function. There are some nice
syntax features for the way you define them, and a few extra features
for how they&#8217;re called, but they&#8217;re all just functions. Some might be
anonymous, while others might be bound to a symbol. Sometimes you call
them by name, or with funcall or apply if you need to pass them
around. Sometimes they&#8217;re a multimethod from CLOS which dispatches
depending on the class of the argument, but at the end of the day
they&#8217;re all just functions which behave the same. Ruby picked up on the
idea of using different syntax for some functions (think Blocks), but
for some reason included Procs and Lambdas as well. Most Rubyists I&#8217;ve
met express confusion over what the exact differences are, and always
say &#8220;Just use one kind and one kind only&#8221;.</p>

<p>Common Lisp also has much better syntax for parameters. In particular it
provides for required and optional positional parameters, enumerated
keyword parameters, and extra parameters to be collected into a
list. Ruby learned well by also allowing default parameters to be
evaluated at call time, but it ended up with a way worse
syntax. Particularly bad is the way Ruby handles extra keyword
arguments, simply dumping them into a lisp, optionally merging it on top
of your default arguments hash if needed. CL provides a way for default
values to be defined for keyword arguments in the method header, which
is far cleaner than the Ruby way.</p>

<h2>DSLs</h2>

<p>Ruby often gets compared to Common Lisp in its ability to produce Domain
Specific Languages, or DSLs. Both blocks and Ruby&#8217;s special dispatch
mechanisms are used and abused by programs such as Chef to create an
easy interface between high level concepts and low level details.</p>

<p>And Ruby is pretty good at DSLs, I would estimate that it can hit a good
60-80% of the DSL cases fairly easily. But especially once you step
outside the bounds of configuration DSLs like Chef, Common Lisp truly
shines. In Ruby you can&#8217;t really add new syntax or special characters,
and you can&#8217;t easily force it to recompile a given section of code to
behave in a specific way.</p>

<p>But you can do that in Lisp. Lisp&#8217;s macros are so powerful, many
languages are first prototyped as a large section of Lisp
macros. Clojure was originally implemented in a few hundred lines of
Lisp macros. This involved adding new meanings to symbols that don&#8217;t
exist in CL, like { and }. But with Lisp&#8217;s reader and regular macros,
this is perfectly reasonable.</p>

<h2>Fragmentation</h2>

<p>One of the biggest weaknesses of Common Lisp was its weak standard. The
standard did not specify a lot of common behavior, such as
threading. The result was a proliferation of both libraries that were
implementation specific, and libraries designed to bridge the gap, like
<a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/">Bordeaux Threads</a>. At
this point every library and application is so set in its ways, the
chances of the standard being unified and fixed is almost none.</p>

<p>Yet somehow Ruby ended up with no spec at all, only a reference
implementation. It&#8217;s so bad that the Rubinius people proudly proclaim
that they created 20,000 specifications to as closely as possible match
MRI, the reference implementation.  While this is a laudable effort, I
think the general opinion is that only the reference implementation is
to be trusted, so most libraries assume that you&#8217;re not using Rubinius,
MacRuby, or anything else. This is sad, because it means that the Ruby
community is very unlikely to use anything other than MRI, no matter how
good a competing runtime might be.</p>

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>

<p>I love Ruby. It&#8217;s a good language. But if you want truly mind opening
programming moments, Lisp is the only way to go. No other language can
give you the sense of &#8220;I can do <em>anything</em>&#8221; quite like it. I highly
recommend every Rubyist at least try Common Lisp for a bit, to at least
understand where their language of choice came from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most scary moments in most young adults&#8217; life is the
realization of mortality. Teenagers and younger children often
understand on an intellectual level that people die, but emotionally
that&#8217;s something that happens to other people. There&#8217;s very few things
quite like the moment when an adult realizes that they must die, there&#8217;s
nothing they can do to stop it, and there&#8217;s not a lot they can do to
delay it.</p>

<p>Most people stop there. But if you move beyond the &#8220;go to work, make
money, enjoy weekend&#8221; stage of your life, you&#8217;ll get to experience what
I call &#8220;Opportunity Cost Fear&#8221;.</p>

<p>Every action you take prevents you from taking another. Spending $10 on
a lunch means you can&#8217;t spend that $10 on anything else. This is called
opportunity cost. It applies to every limited resource in the
world. Your time, attention, money, emotions, energy, and physical
strength are all subject to opportunity cost, even though many people
and organizations do not think about it.</p>

<p>Those who wish to accomplish many things can suffer a crippling fear
because of it. Spending time on this blog post means I&#8217;m spending time
not reading blogs, writing software, or talking with Leah. It also means
I&#8217;m not spending my time going to the gym to be healthy, or trying to
make friends in a new city. And the fact that I can&#8217;t have everything I
want, just like the fact that I can&#8217;t live forever, can be deeply
terrifying if you care about doing multiple things.</p>

<p>Just like the fear of death, the best way out of opportunity cost fear
is to press forward. The big risk with both is that the fear will
cripple you to the point where the worst might as well have
happened. Are you really living if you spend every moment terrified of
your own end? What&#8217;s the point worrying about opportunity cost if the
fear prevents you from executing on any of your plans? In both these
cases, the fear alone can be just as bad as the actual outcome.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that the rational choice is disregard for the
objects of your fear. If you&#8217;re afraid of death, riding a motorcycle
without a helmet on will neither eliminate your fear or increase your
lifespan. You should be aware of why you feared a thing, and take the
most rational steps to reduce it. Nothing you will do can ever eliminate
opportunity cost, but you can make sure that you&#8217;re spending your time
as best you can. You&#8217;ll never do it perfectly, but it&#8217;s better than
nothing at all.</p>

<time datetime="2013-10-26T21:36:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 26<span>th</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com">Merlin Mann</a> gives a great talk about Time
and Attention. The gist of his talk is that in order to create great
work, you need to balance time vs. attention. Without using your time,
you&#8217;ll never create. But you must use your attention to determine if
you&#8217;re creating something great. Great producers balance between these
two to both produce, and produce good work.</p>

<p>Part of my new job at <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a>
involves pair programming. While a lot of my programming friends express
doubt about pairing, I&#8217;m very impressed with both how productive I am
pairing, and how quickly I&#8217;m learning the code base while pairing.</p>

<p>The way that a good pair switches between who is &#8220;driving&#8221; is very
similar to Merlin&#8217;s talk. The person who is typing is responsible for
producing, while the person who isn&#8217;t is responsible for ensuring that
the pair is headed in the right direction. Pairs have a much easier time
finding this balance and staying on track than individual workers do.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to alternate between time and attention effectively when
working alone. There&#8217;s no overt signal to when one is using time or
attention, making it easy to mistake &#8220;research&#8221; (reading Wikipedia) as
using your attention. As a pair this balance is much easier to achieve,
because each member is tasked with one role, and it&#8217;s obvious when that
role is not being fulfilled. The non-driving member can&#8217;t goof off on
Reddit or Wikipedia for the sake of &#8220;research&#8221; because it will prevent
the driving member from working. And the driving member can&#8217;t slow down
too much without the other member taking over typing from them. This
helps ensure that the pair produces better code faster.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if the creators of pair programming are familiar with
Merlin&#8217;s model of work, but accidentally or not they&#8217;ve made it much
easier for programmers to follow his advice. I&#8217;d recommend any
company to give pairing a try and see what it does for the quality and
quantity of work that their teams produce.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know those hilarious &#8220;pranks&#8221; where someone posts something
embarrassing someone else&#8217;s Facebook account? Apparently in the improv
community of Chicago the standard prank is to post something saying that
they&#8217;ve accepted a lead role, and that they&#8217;re moving to Denver,
Colorado. We found this out when some improv actors at our going away
party took some convincing that we were actually moving, and that it
wasn&#8217;t an elaborate prank.</p>

<p>The main difference for us is that I&#8217;ve not decided to give up software
engineering for comedy. Instead I&#8217;ve accepted a role as an engineer at
<a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a>, which I personally think is a
better deal. Pivotal is a great company with a unique and productive
style, and I&#8217;m thrilled to be working with them.</p>

<p>While there&#8217;ll always be a special place in my heart for Chicago, I&#8217;m
rather glad we&#8217;ve made the move. It was stressful and very expensive,
but living in Colorado has already been a very pleasant experience. The
weather is shockingly nice, apartments are a nicer for the price, and I
can safely walk to work.</p>

<p>Expect photos from the mountains and trails above Denver in the coming
months.</p>
