  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my new job at Pivotal Labs I&#8217;ve been pair programming almost
every day. The obvious challenge with pair programming, especially in a
popular language like ruby, is in choosing what tools to work with. Vim,
Emacs, RubyMine, TextMate, the choices are various and divisive.</p>

<p>To make peace among the engineers, it makes sense to dictate one set of
tools to make peace among all your employees, and to make provisioning
the machines easier. Pivotal has decided to standardize on RubyMine with
a dark color scheme and a few custom configurations.</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>

<p>RubyMine, being set up for ruby in particular, works very well with
navigating, indenting, and colorizing ruby code. With the exception of
setting a variable as the result of an if expression, I have never seen
RubyMine indent code incorrectly or get confused on coloration.</p>

<p>It also does a decent job of navigating to ruby classes and functions,
something that is quite hard since ruby lacks explicit import
semantics. It definitely makes hunting down odd test harness functions
down a breeze, and has saved me in the past. It also is good at
identifying the view that cooresponds to a controller method, but due to
the way that tracker is laid out, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to use this
feature often.</p>

<p>And as the cherry on top RubyMine includes a &#8220;Textmate like&#8221; quick find
feature. In large code bases this will save you about a minute trying to
find a particular file, so ling as you have an idea of what it&#8217;s called!</p>

<h1>The Bad</h1>

<p>If you only have unique controllers and models, you will absolutely love
the ability to jump to a class definition. Since we use a lot of
similarly named controllers inside namespaces to control API versions,
it often gets confused about what version I want. The quick find feature
sometimes ignores the path if you provide it, which makes copying files
from stacktraces occasionally unreliable.</p>

<p>Javascript and less support is mediocre. No real complaints, but nothing
to set it apart from other environments in my opinion. Maybe my
colleagues who work on the front end would have a more nuanced opinion.</p>

<p>Also sometimes with large files the coloring or error checking can lag
behind. This usually kicks in at files longer than 3000 lines, which is
not unusual for test files. For the most part this is just an annoyance
which doesn&#8217;t affect editing in any serious way.</p>

<p>It has git integration, which lags behind the offerings from Emacs, Vim,
and Eclipse in my opinion. I end up using the command line instead of
the built in tools.</p>

<h1>The Ugly</h1>

<p>RubyMine is incredibly dim witted when it comes to parenthesis and
quotes. If you wish to put an escaped quote at the end of a string,
RubyMine will let you escape your ending quote, then insert a matching
pair right afterwords when you try and fix the mistake! To add insult to
injury, you must move the cursor before fixing the issue lest RubyMine
delete both of the extra quotes. Very frustrating.</p>

<p>RubyMine is also one of the most memory consuming programs I use. At
least once a week it will grind my machine to a halt due to memory
usage, which is impressive on a machine with 16G in memory.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>Out of the box, RubyMine works very well. I think it is a good
compromise for large teams. But if you have time to learn some more
complicated tools, I believe you would be way better off learning a more
customizable editor like Emacs or Vim. It might take some effort, but
these editors can do just as much as their commercial cousins and will
continue to do well no matter what language you decide to use in the
future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve taken interest in making myself more productive, and at
least so far it&#8217;s going well. I personally attribute part of my current
productivity to a new &#8220;shut up and get back to work&#8221; mentality, and
partly to a new (to me) organization system.</p>

<p>The problem I&#8217;ve had is that every single organization app is broken in
some way. The only truly flexible system uses paper and pen, and I
don&#8217;t really want to deal with that.</p>

<p>The solution appears to be org-files. Think of them as a close cousin to
Markdown, but for organization instead of HTML. The systems that use
org-files support basically any kind of work flow imaginable because
the storage mechanism is just text, so in the worst case scenario you
can always just edit the file manually.</p>

<p>Org-files are originally from the Emacs plugin org-mode, but there are
now org-file readers for Vim, iPhone, and Android.</p>

<h2>Okay Ashton, What the Hell is That?</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s break this down bit by bit. Any line starting with <code>#+</code>
is used to tell the org-mode reader something. In this case it lets us
know the last time we synced this to our mobile device, and the possible
TODO states that an item can be in. It&#8217;s not unusual to see formatting
directives at the top of the file to control color, indentation, and
similar settings. A lot of settings can either be set globally, or on a
per-file basis.</p>

<p>Next we have the individual headings. Each heading starts with a number
of asterisks. The number of asterisks indicates the level. So
<code>&#42;&#42; Wish List.</code> is a child of <code>&#42;
Butler</code>. Most editors allow you to fold headings to show or hide
their children, for convenience.</p>

<p>Each heading can optionally have a TODO state, which is displayed in
front of the heading title.. The default is one of blank, TODO,
IN-PROGRESS, and DONE. A simple keystroke in most editors cycles from
one state to the next. It&#8217;s also possible to support multiple paths that
a project can flow through. I personally use the default along with
REFERENCE and ABANDONED, which allows for me to easily filter for
abandoned projects, along with notes that aren&#8217;t actionable yet.</p>

<p>Org-mode supports 3 different kinds of time tracking and
scheduling. Each heading can have up to one deadline entry, one
scheduled entry, and multiple clock entries. Deadlines are for when an
item should be finished, and scheduled is for when a project should be
started. Clocks are for recording the amount of time used for an
item. You can see an example of both the deadline and clock under the
&#8220;Better formatting.&#8221;  header. Org-mode also supports a very flexible
type of repeat scheduling.</p>

<p>With any good organization system you&#8217;ll need the ability to tag and
filter items. Org provides two ways to do this, properties and
tags. Tags are generally shared across multiple entries, with values
like &#8220;work&#8221; and &#8220;home&#8221;. They are displayed on the far right of the
tagged line, such as &#8220;:projects:&#8221; on the Butler line above. You can tag
a line with as many tags as you want.</p>

<p>Unlike tags, properties are composed of keys and values, many of which
are unique to a specific entry. If you use any kind of syncing system,
each item will get an ID property used to enforce uniqueness. A lot of
systems will also respect the LOCATION property if you sync to a system
that understands this, such as iCal.</p>

<p>And finally you can have notes and text underneath each entry. Most
org-mode readers understand free text, unordered lists (<code>-</code>
or <code>+</code>), numbered lists, and check boxes (<code>- [ ]</code>
and <code>- [X]</code>). Many of these can be easily manipulated with
simple keyboard macros, such as the check boxes.</p>

<p>As you can see, org-mode basically provides a super set of all the
organizational features available. It&#8217;s up to you how you wish to nest
these, mark them due, and prioritize. That&#8217;s why I love it, I&#8217;m not
locked into one particular layout that may or may not fit me, instead I
can slowly evolve it as my systems mature. Expect more posts in the
future about Emacs specific configuration settings to make org-mode
easier to use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Edit: Dan Benjamin himself informed me that I missed the sarcasm boat
here. I&#8217;m leaving the relevant bits, and cutting out the now irrelevant
criticism.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m slowly working my way through the <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a>
podcast. I&#8217;m way behind, so please excuse that this post references an
episode over 2 years old at this point.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/11">Episode 11</a> was about &#8220;future proofing your
passion&#8221;, among other things. In it, Merlin mentions that one thing you
can do as a low risk investment in a programming career is to maintain
current on new languages. He mentions Scala, Erlang, and Lisp as a
few. With an <del>uncharacteristic lack of self-awareness</del> unusual
amount of sarcasm, Dan expresses pretty much disdain and lack of
interest in anything other than Ruby, even going as far as saying &#8220;Ruby
took the best of Lisp&#8221;.</p>

<p>While Dan may have been joking, it is probably worth examining the
relationship between Ruby and Lisp. As someone who has worked in Ruby
and Lisp professionally, I feel uniquely qualified to talk about their
relative strengths. While there are a ton of cases where Ruby clearly
learned and copied from Lisp, there is also a laundry list of areas
where Ruby failed to learn from Lisp&#8217;s successes and failures.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>Being a functional language, functions are pretty important to Common
Lisp. Ruby thankfully took some of the highlights from CL during its
development, like a heavy emphasis on using map &amp; filter over iterative
loops, but it missed some important things.</p>

<p>CL only has one kind of function, the function. There are some nice
syntax features for the way you define them, and a few extra features
for how they&#8217;re called, but they&#8217;re all just functions. Some might be
anonymous, while others might be bound to a symbol. Sometimes you call
them by name, or with funcall or apply if you need to pass them
around. Sometimes they&#8217;re a multimethod from CLOS which dispatches
depending on the class of the argument, but at the end of the day
they&#8217;re all just functions which behave the same. Ruby picked up on the
idea of using different syntax for some functions (think Blocks), but
for some reason included Procs and Lambdas as well. Most Rubyists I&#8217;ve
met express confusion over what the exact differences are, and always
say &#8220;Just use one kind and one kind only&#8221;.</p>

<p>Common Lisp also has much better syntax for parameters. In particular it
provides for required and optional positional parameters, enumerated
keyword parameters, and extra parameters to be collected into a
list. Ruby learned well by also allowing default parameters to be
evaluated at call time, but it ended up with a way worse
syntax. Particularly bad is the way Ruby handles extra keyword
arguments, simply dumping them into a lisp, optionally merging it on top
of your default arguments hash if needed. CL provides a way for default
values to be defined for keyword arguments in the method header, which
is far cleaner than the Ruby way.</p>

<h2>DSLs</h2>

<p>Ruby often gets compared to Common Lisp in its ability to produce Domain
Specific Languages, or DSLs. Both blocks and Ruby&#8217;s special dispatch
mechanisms are used and abused by programs such as Chef to create an
easy interface between high level concepts and low level details.</p>

<p>And Ruby is pretty good at DSLs, I would estimate that it can hit a good
60-80% of the DSL cases fairly easily. But especially once you step
outside the bounds of configuration DSLs like Chef, Common Lisp truly
shines. In Ruby you can&#8217;t really add new syntax or special characters,
and you can&#8217;t easily force it to recompile a given section of code to
behave in a specific way.</p>

<p>But you can do that in Lisp. Lisp&#8217;s macros are so powerful, many
languages are first prototyped as a large section of Lisp
macros. Clojure was originally implemented in a few hundred lines of
Lisp macros. This involved adding new meanings to symbols that don&#8217;t
exist in CL, like { and }. But with Lisp&#8217;s reader and regular macros,
this is perfectly reasonable.</p>

<h2>Fragmentation</h2>

<p>One of the biggest weaknesses of Common Lisp was its weak standard. The
standard did not specify a lot of common behavior, such as
threading. The result was a proliferation of both libraries that were
implementation specific, and libraries designed to bridge the gap, like
<a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/">Bordeaux Threads</a>. At
this point every library and application is so set in its ways, the
chances of the standard being unified and fixed is almost none.</p>

<p>Yet somehow Ruby ended up with no spec at all, only a reference
implementation. It&#8217;s so bad that the Rubinius people proudly proclaim
that they created 20,000 specifications to as closely as possible match
MRI, the reference implementation.  While this is a laudable effort, I
think the general opinion is that only the reference implementation is
to be trusted, so most libraries assume that you&#8217;re not using Rubinius,
MacRuby, or anything else. This is sad, because it means that the Ruby
community is very unlikely to use anything other than MRI, no matter how
good a competing runtime might be.</p>

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>

<p>I love Ruby. It&#8217;s a good language. But if you want truly mind opening
programming moments, Lisp is the only way to go. No other language can
give you the sense of &#8220;I can do <em>anything</em>&#8221; quite like it. I highly
recommend every Rubyist at least try Common Lisp for a bit, to at least
understand where their language of choice came from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most scary moments in most young adults&#8217; life is the
realization of mortality. Teenagers and younger children often
understand on an intellectual level that people die, but emotionally
that&#8217;s something that happens to other people. There&#8217;s very few things
quite like the moment when an adult realizes that they must die, there&#8217;s
nothing they can do to stop it, and there&#8217;s not a lot they can do to
delay it.</p>

<p>Most people stop there. But if you move beyond the &#8220;go to work, make
money, enjoy weekend&#8221; stage of your life, you&#8217;ll get to experience what
I call &#8220;Opportunity Cost Fear&#8221;.</p>

<p>Every action you take prevents you from taking another. Spending $10 on
a lunch means you can&#8217;t spend that $10 on anything else. This is called
opportunity cost. It applies to every limited resource in the
world. Your time, attention, money, emotions, energy, and physical
strength are all subject to opportunity cost, even though many people
and organizations do not think about it.</p>

<p>Those who wish to accomplish many things can suffer a crippling fear
because of it. Spending time on this blog post means I&#8217;m spending time
not reading blogs, writing software, or talking with Leah. It also means
I&#8217;m not spending my time going to the gym to be healthy, or trying to
make friends in a new city. And the fact that I can&#8217;t have everything I
want, just like the fact that I can&#8217;t live forever, can be deeply
terrifying if you care about doing multiple things.</p>

<p>Just like the fear of death, the best way out of opportunity cost fear
is to press forward. The big risk with both is that the fear will
cripple you to the point where the worst might as well have
happened. Are you really living if you spend every moment terrified of
your own end? What&#8217;s the point worrying about opportunity cost if the
fear prevents you from executing on any of your plans? In both these
cases, the fear alone can be just as bad as the actual outcome.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that the rational choice is disregard for the
objects of your fear. If you&#8217;re afraid of death, riding a motorcycle
without a helmet on will neither eliminate your fear or increase your
lifespan. You should be aware of why you feared a thing, and take the
most rational steps to reduce it. Nothing you will do can ever eliminate
opportunity cost, but you can make sure that you&#8217;re spending your time
as best you can. You&#8217;ll never do it perfectly, but it&#8217;s better than
nothing at all.</p>

<time datetime="2013-10-26T21:36:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 26<span>th</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com">Merlin Mann</a> gives a great talk about Time
and Attention. The gist of his talk is that in order to create great
work, you need to balance time vs. attention. Without using your time,
you&#8217;ll never create. But you must use your attention to determine if
you&#8217;re creating something great. Great producers balance between these
two to both produce, and produce good work.</p>

<p>Part of my new job at <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a>
involves pair programming. While a lot of my programming friends express
doubt about pairing, I&#8217;m very impressed with both how productive I am
pairing, and how quickly I&#8217;m learning the code base while pairing.</p>

<p>The way that a good pair switches between who is &#8220;driving&#8221; is very
similar to Merlin&#8217;s talk. The person who is typing is responsible for
producing, while the person who isn&#8217;t is responsible for ensuring that
the pair is headed in the right direction. Pairs have a much easier time
finding this balance and staying on track than individual workers do.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to alternate between time and attention effectively when
working alone. There&#8217;s no overt signal to when one is using time or
attention, making it easy to mistake &#8220;research&#8221; (reading Wikipedia) as
using your attention. As a pair this balance is much easier to achieve,
because each member is tasked with one role, and it&#8217;s obvious when that
role is not being fulfilled. The non-driving member can&#8217;t goof off on
Reddit or Wikipedia for the sake of &#8220;research&#8221; because it will prevent
the driving member from working. And the driving member can&#8217;t slow down
too much without the other member taking over typing from them. This
helps ensure that the pair produces better code faster.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if the creators of pair programming are familiar with
Merlin&#8217;s model of work, but accidentally or not they&#8217;ve made it much
easier for programmers to follow his advice. I&#8217;d recommend any
company to give pairing a try and see what it does for the quality and
quantity of work that their teams produce.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know those hilarious &#8220;pranks&#8221; where someone posts something
embarrassing someone else&#8217;s Facebook account? Apparently in the improv
community of Chicago the standard prank is to post something saying that
they&#8217;ve accepted a lead role, and that they&#8217;re moving to Denver,
Colorado. We found this out when some improv actors at our going away
party took some convincing that we were actually moving, and that it
wasn&#8217;t an elaborate prank.</p>

<p>The main difference for us is that I&#8217;ve not decided to give up software
engineering for comedy. Instead I&#8217;ve accepted a role as an engineer at
<a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a>, which I personally think is a
better deal. Pivotal is a great company with a unique and productive
style, and I&#8217;m thrilled to be working with them.</p>

<p>While there&#8217;ll always be a special place in my heart for Chicago, I&#8217;m
rather glad we&#8217;ve made the move. It was stressful and very expensive,
but living in Colorado has already been a very pleasant experience. The
weather is shockingly nice, apartments are a nicer for the price, and I
can safely walk to work.</p>

<p>Expect photos from the mountains and trails above Denver in the coming
months.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone who knows me personally knows that I am a huge Clojure fan. I could go on and on about why it&#8217;s the best; the regularity, the macros, ClojureScript, core.logic, etc. etc.</p>

<p>But last week I attended <a href="http://lambdajam.com">LambdaJam</a>, which was awesome by the way, and I came back with a different opinion. No, I don&#8217;t think Haskell or Erlang tops out Clojure, I&#8217;m still probably going to reach for Leiningen for all my personal projects. But I learned that it&#8217;s a good idea to keep an eye on other languages, since no language will ever be so good that you never need to touch anything else.</p>

<p>In particular I learned the joy of the APL based languages, especially J. I learned that the F# people have a novel way of dealing with statically typing external resources via type providers, and I learned that Haskell can indeed be tight and clean despite what all those monad tutorials imply. I will probably take each of these subjects apart in separate posts in the future, I&#8217;m still trying to pick up bits and pieces of my thoughts after several intense key notes overloaded my brain.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the take away? That functional languages are a lot more diverse than most OOP/procedural languages, and that there&#8217;s a lot that can be learned from them. So instead of picking your favorite and only learning that, you really should try to learn several to cover your bases.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favorite tricks is to borrow terminology from other walks in life. This is particularly important for me, since it&#8217;s all too easy for engineers to end up living and talking in pure engineering speak. Looking to other careers for the correct words to describe something allows one to express ideas that might not be easily communicated otherwise.</p>

<p>If you look carefully, you can see examples of this in engineering blog posts. People talk about fighting entropy, or the metaphysics of data. These are terms that did not originally have any engineering context whatsoever, being brought in to express ideas and concepts about another subject.</p>

<p>My most recent borrowed term is <em>Force Multiplier</em>. A force multiplier is anything that allows an group or individual to be more effective without an increase in effort. It&#8217;s normally a military term referencing how better weather forecasts, equipment, or intelligence can allow a unit to accomplish much more without increasing effort/losses. I like to use it in reference to things like unit tests and automation, that make me more effective as an engineer without costing me more time. If I don&#8217;t have to babysit a build waiting to type in the next step, then I can get back to work while a CI server works for me. I&#8217;m instantly more effective without actually spending more time at work. With a comprehensive suite of unit tests I can spend less time worrying and validating that my refactoring has damaged the quality of the system, thus I can get more work done in the same period of time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there are far more examples of this than I&#8217;ve listed, but they&#8217;re always fun to find and analyze.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the distant past (1950&#8217;s or so), project managers and engineers came up with what is known as the project management triangle: fast, cheap, or good; pick two.</p>

<p>While software engineering can be very different from mechanical, it does at least share the same project management setup. Quality software designed cheaply will be late, cheap software released early will be poor in quality, and quality software released on time will be expensive. These differences come from the quality and number (thus cost) of the managers and engineers, the choice of methodologies, scope of features, and internal organizational setups.</p>

<p>What is different is the fact that software engineers aren&#8217;t limited by physics the way that our mechanical brethren are. With few exceptions for high performance computing, the limitation of most software projects is the imagination and effort of its engineers, not hard limits in manufacturing technologies or physics. Combine this with a fad-heavy market for programming methods (scrum! extreme! agile! pair!), and it can be very tempting to assume that we can find the perfect balance with the correct management processes and the right methodology.</p>

<p>This is false, of course. Management and methodology is about dealing with the communication overhead when enough people are working on an project. The pipe dream of management and methodology is for a group of N producers to produce N times more than one person alone. This is of course rubbish, as the <em>Mythical Man Month</em> demonstrated handily, it&#8217;s simply impossible to manage or process your way to good, cheap, and fast.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the point of it all then? Why don&#8217;t we just go back to waterfall? Because the point of agile, scrum, pair programming and friends is <strong>not</strong> to get us all the way to good, cheap, and fast. The point is to go from choosing one of three, to choosing two of three. A poorly managed, low discipline team can only choose one of good, cheap, and fast; and this is of course worthless. Cheap software that&#8217;s late will probably still run out of VC and be beaten by the competition. Bad and cheap software will struggle to take over the market, and software that&#8217;s both bad and late probably shouldn&#8217;t be written. However a well managed, well disciplined team can survey the market, measure the competition, and <em>knowingly</em> choose what compromises they wish to make in speed, quality, and cost. Poorly managed teams blunder into one of the choices, usually cheap and bad, and end up having very little control over their own fate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are almost as many design principles as there are articles about them. But my two favorites are the Principle of Least Surprise, and You Ain&#8217;t Gonna Need It.</p>

<p>The Principle of Least Surprise, is one of the design principles of the language Ruby, specifically in the context of &#8220;the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well.&#8221; And all good systems have the property that they do not surprise experienced users, but great systems do not even surprise inexperienced users. This is what Apple has been doing for years, trying to make their products mimic familiar scenarios and objects from the real world, so that users can simply pick up the product and use it.</p>

<p>You Ain&#8217;t Gonna Need It is actually a programming principle, stating that you should never add features under the assumption that someone might need it someday. Chances are that users either won&#8217;t need it, won&#8217;t want it, or will end up preferring something significantly different than what you provided. But I think this principle can be simplified down to &#8220;provide the minimum set of options and features to allow users to complete the task&#8221;. Simpler products are easier to learn, easier to master, and easier to create and test. The only extra work is in designing it properly.</p>

<p>With this in mind, let&#8217;s turn towards Ubuntu. I&#8217;m hardly a Linux novice, having used Gentoo, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, openSuse, and others before eventually converting to Mac OSX. I had to upgrade my spare Ubuntu box this week from 12.04 all the way to 13.04, and found a few gripes.</p>

<p>First of all, there&#8217;s the Amazon search feature they added sometime in the 11.X releases. It slows the search box down, which is the main way that applications are opened, and clutters up the results. Besides being a transparent money grab, I have a hard time imagining someone trying to open up their music client and suddenly deciding that they need to buy some cheese crackers <em>right now</em>. It all seems like quite a bit of distraction in order to enable a few users that want to order from Amazon without having to fire up Chrome first.</p>

<p>But the part that really angered me was when I tried to turn this &#8220;feature&#8221; off. I couldn&#8217;t find any settings within the dock itself (right clicking does nothing, it seems), and I couldn&#8217;t find any reference to it in the system settings panel either. A quick trip to Google, which I feel shouldn&#8217;t have been necessary, told me that I could turn this search off in the Privacy settings, for some reason. As annoying as this was, all would be well if the upgrade to 12.10 didn&#8217;t <strong>turn it back on again</strong>. Why would you do that to me, Ubuntu? I clearly stated that I had no interest in this mis-feature by hunting it down and disabling it, what purpose does re-enabling it have other than grab a bit more money from Amazon and anger me?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s these little mis-steps and more that make or break the user experience of a product. I&#8217;m fairly tech savvy, and am comfortable digging through StackExchange and various forums to find some solutions to my problems, but that&#8217;s not the way that the average customer works. For those who aren&#8217;t comfortable looking up answers or editing configuration files, these little details will quickly scare them away to an operating system that&#8217;s less surprising and simpler. And these are the users that Canonical must attract if they&#8217;re hoping to turn Ubuntu into a mainstream Operating System.</p>
