      <description>Today Iâ€™m going to start a new series of blog posts unrelated to my typical programming affair. This is actually an out-growth of a prior failed attempt to create a podcast, and if this series proves popular enough I might try again.
So, why am I doing this? Well, obviously this is partly a response to being quarantined 24/7 during the Coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. Without the ability to leave the house, there is only so many video games that a given person can play without slowly losing their mind.</description>
