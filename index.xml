      <description>Experience Hulu (2020 - Current) Hulu is the leading premium streaming service offering live and on-demand TV and movies, with and without commercials. Hulu is the only service that gives viewers instant access to current shows from every major U.S. broadcast network; libraries of hit TV series and films; and acclaimed Hulu Originals. Hulu also streams live news, entertainment and sports.
At Hulu I lead the DVR team, which is responsible for powering the Cloud DVR feature for Hulu Live TV customers.</description>

      <description>Programmer, podcaster, fisherman, and nerd extraordinaire. By day I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer, and by night I&amp;rsquo;m a nerd, or is that redundant?
At my day job I am a manager and engineer working for Hulu in beautiful Santa Monica California.
Professionally, my experience is all over the place. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in old small companies, startups, Dell backed consultancies, and finance. In the mean time I&amp;rsquo;ve written code in Java, C#, Ruby, Javascript, Clojure, Python, and even Common Lisp!</description>
