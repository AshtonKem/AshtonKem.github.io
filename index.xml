      <description>Experience Edmunds (2017 - 2019) Edmunds.com is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s premier car research and buying websites. First created in 1966, Edmunds&amp;rsquo; main goal has been making the car buying process easier for the consumer. Based out of beautiful Santa Monica California, Edmunds has consistently been rated one of the best places to work in LA. It also has an amazing office.
At Everest I was a tech lead for a variety of teams, leading a maximum of nine engineers.</description>

      <description>Programmer, podcaster, fisherman, and nerd extraordinaire. By day I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer, and by night I&amp;rsquo;m a nerd, or is that redundant?
At my day job I am a manager and engineer working for Edmunds in beautiful Santa Monica California. By night I continue to code on the side and cohost CounterSteer, a car podcast.
Professionally, my experience is all over the place. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in old small companies, startups, Dell backed consultancies, and finance.</description>
