            <p class="note title">Java Doesn't Deserve Half the Shit We Give It</p><p class="note date">January 22, 2013</p><p class="note content">It’s very popular among programmers to diss Java on Reddit and Hacker News. But Java really isn’t that bad of a language, and I really think there are other reasons why people hate it.
While we like to pretend that programming language choice is purely about practicality, there is a very large social aspect to it. Nobody wants to admit to liking Cobol or VBA, and being at the forefront of a new, exciting language can bring a type of prestige in programming circles.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/right-vs-useful/">
            <p class="note title">Right vs Useful</p><p class="note date">January 3, 2013</p><p class="note content">I spend a fairly decent amount of my time thinking about how my mindset and world view affects my decisions and actions. In the past few months I’ve found that how I evaluate these mindsets has begun to change; I used to be mostly concerned with whether or not a mindset was correct, but now I’ve started to think about whether or not it’s useful.
Determining whether or not a mindset is correct is rather tricky philosophical ground, as it requires some sort of platonic “reality” to compare it against.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/learn-what-you-dont-like/">
            <p class="note title">Learn What You Don't Like</p><p class="note date">December 10, 2012</p><p class="note content">There’s really nothing worse than someone who has lived their life surrounded by people who agree with them fully. People who live this way have confidence that precedes their knowledge, and will treat contradictory knowledge as an attack on their in-group and world view.
While the above mentioned effect is generally most common in religion and politics, it crops up sometimes in engineering in the so called “holy wars”. Linux vs.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/hands-and-feet/">
            <p class="note title">Hands and Feet</p><p class="note date">December 1, 2012</p><p class="note content">When I was a teenager I worked at a large amusement park in the games department, which I guess technically means I was a carnie. One of the more interesting games I worked at was the rope ladder; in order to win the game contestants had to climb up a rope ladder set at a 45 degree angle and attached to swivel points at the bottom. Unsurprisingly I learned to climb it easily (free tries and boredom does wonders for learning), but I witnessed very few winners.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/reaction-to-kill-your-heroes-and-comments/">
            <p class="note title">Reaction to Kill Your Heroes and Comments</p><p class="note date">November 29, 2012</p><p class="note content">Will Larsen had a nice post about what he calls Hero Programmers . Put simply, his theory is that some projects end up in a state where they count on massive effort by a select few heroes on the team. The problem is that this upsets those who aren’t heroes, burns out the heroes, and still won’t save an ailing project.
What was particularly interesting to me was some of the responses on Reddit.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/the-myth-of-the-lone-hacker/">
            <p class="note title">The Myth of the Lone Hacker</p><p class="note date">November 22, 2012</p><p class="note content">Most programmers start off their career relatively idealistic, and often marvel at the power of little used programming languages. For me, this language was Common Lisp, which I got to work with professionally. At first I believed that Lisp still had the power to revolutionize programming, but after a few years of work I realized exactly why Lisp ended up in the position it is now: community. Every programming community has a few core beliefs, both explicit and implicit, that shape the language, the libraries, and its users.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
